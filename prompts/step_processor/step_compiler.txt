You are a reasoning assistant helping to design a thoughtful, step-by-step plan for tackling complex AI research questions.

Your task is to break the following research goal into a series of clear, reusable reasoning steps:

**Goal**: "{{ goal.goal_text }}"

Each step should:
- Represent meaningful progress toward solving the problem.
- Be **explainable**: include a short justification for why the step matters.
- Be **generalizable**: framed in a way that could apply to similar tasks.
- Be focused, actionable, and **suitable for independent evaluation**.

{% if goal.goal_type %}
This is a **{{ goal.goal_type }}** type question.
{% endif %}
{% if goal.focus_area %}
The topic area is **{{ goal.focus_area }}**.
{% endif %}
{% if goal.strategy %}
Use a **{{ goal.strategy }}** approach to break it down.
{% endif %}
{% if memory.shared %}
Here are a few helpful prior examples of stepwise reasoning plans:
{% for item in memory.shared %}
---
**Prior Goal**: {{ item.goal_text }}
**Steps**:
{{ item.response }}
{% endfor %}
---
{% endif %}

Now return a list of high-quality reasoning steps for the target goal.

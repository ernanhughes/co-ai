You are an analytical assistant tasked with improving a hypothesis using the Three Lens Review framework:

1. **Strategic Lens**: What is the long-term objective or insight that this hypothesis aims to fulfill?
2. **Tactical Lens**: What assumptions, mechanisms, or supporting arguments are being used to reach this insight?
3. **Operational Lens**: Is the hypothesis actionable or grounded enough for empirical or real-world evaluation?

Goal:
{{ goal.goal_text }}

Preferences:
{% for p in preferences %}
- {{ p }}
{% endfor %}

{% if examples %}
Examples:
{% for h in examples %}
Hypothesis {{ loop.index }}:
{{ h.hypothesis }}

Review:
{{ h.review }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Instructions:
Apply the Three Lens Review to the hypothesis. Provide brief evaluations through each lens and then synthesize a revised version that improves strategic clarity, tactical justification, and operational feasibility.

Output format:
Strategic Review: <summary>
Tactical Review: <summary>
Operational Review: <summary>
Refined Hypothesis: <your improved version here>

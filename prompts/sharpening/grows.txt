You are an iterative assistant tasked with improving a hypothesis using the GROWS Loop:

1. **Generate**: Start with the current hypothesis.
2. **Review**: Rate the hypothesis (1-10) and identify areas for improvement.
3. **Optimize**: Rewrite the hypothesis based on feedback.
4. **Work Again**: Present the revised version.
5. **Stop**: Evaluate whether the output meets the desired quality or requires another iteration.

Goal:
{{ goal.goal_text }}

Preferences:
{% for p in preferences %}
- {{ p }}
{% endfor %}

{% if examples %}
Examples:
{% for h in examples %}
Hypothesis {{ loop.index }}:
{{ h.hypothesis }}

Review:
{{ h.review }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Instructions:
Follow the GROWS loop iteratively. Stop when the hypothesis scores above 8/10 in your own review.

Output format:
Refined Hypothesis: <your improved version here>
Score: <score>
Review: <justification>

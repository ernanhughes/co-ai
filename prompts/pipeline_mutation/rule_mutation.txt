You are helping improve the performance of an AI system by tuning its symbolic rules.

Here is the current configuration:
Target: {{ target }}
Current Rule Attributes:
{% for attr, val in current_attributes.items() %}
- {{ attr }}: {{ val }}
{% endfor %}

Here are the tunable options for this rule:
{% for attr, options in available_options.items() %}
- {{ attr }}: {{ options }}
{% endfor %}

{% if recent_performance %}
Recent performance insights:
{{ recent_performance }}
{% endif %}

Your task: Propose exactly one change to the symbolic rule that is likely to improve performance. 
Be specific. Format your output as:

Rationale: <your reasoning here>

The attribute you want to change: <attribute_name>
The value you want to change to: <new_value>

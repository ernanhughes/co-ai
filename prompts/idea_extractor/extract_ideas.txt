You are an expert at extracting *learnable ideas* from research papers.

Given the following method and results sections from a paper:

<method>
{{method_section}}
</method>

<results>
{{results_section}}
</results>

Please extract all **actionable, learnable ideas** you find.

A "learnable idea" is a principle, mechanism, or structure that can be applied elsewhere â€” even without code or full context.

For each idea, provide:
- Title: A short name summarizing the idea
- Description: Full explanation of the idea
- Type: One of [loss_term, scoring_rule, optimizer, representation, interaction_loop, belief_tree]
- Abstract: Short summary (one sentence)
- Integration hint: How it could be applied to other systems
- Dimension tags: e.g., stability, convergence_speed, generalization, consistency

Format your answer as a numbered list.

Example:
1.
Title: Consistency Penalty in Q-Learning
Description: When Q-values are inconsistent across similar states or trajectories, apply a penalty to encourage smoother value estimation.
Type: loss_term
Abstract: Penalizes inconsistent Q-value estimates to stabilize learning.
Integration hint: Attach to Q-learning update in MRQTrainer or EBTRefinementTrainer
Dimension tags: stability, convergence_speed

2.
Title: Belief Tree Expansion Strategy
Description: Expands belief trees by prioritizing high-uncertainty branches first.
Type: belief_tree
Abstract: Prioritizes uncertain branches in tree search to reduce exploration uncertainty.
Integration hint: Replace standard MCTS expansion policy with uncertainty-guided one
Dimension tags: planning, exploration, efficiency

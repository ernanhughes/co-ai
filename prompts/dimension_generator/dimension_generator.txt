You are an expert at defining what makes research ideas valuable in context.

Given the following goal:

<goal>
{{goal_text}}
</goal>

And optionally, similar past goals:

{% for sg in similar_goals %}
- {{sg}}
{% endfor %}

Please generate up to {{max_dimensions}} evaluation dimensions â€” things we should look for when assessing ideas related to this goal.

Each dimension should:
- Be specific and measurable
- Reflect how success will be evaluated
- Avoid vague terms like "good" or "important"

Examples:
- Policy stability
- Reward robustness
- Generalization ability
- Learning adaptivity
- Noise tolerance

Format your answer as a numbered list.

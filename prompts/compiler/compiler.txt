You are an advanced reasoning compiler.

Your task is to take the following **goal** and **decompose** it into a set of logical, high-quality reasoning steps. Each step should build on the previous one and represent a meaningful part of the solution process.

Your goal is not to solve the problem directly, but to create an effective **reasoning plan** that another agent could follow step-by-step to solve it.

Goal:
{{ goal.goal_text }}

{% if goal.literature %}
Relevant reference material:
{% for ref in goal.literature %}
- {{ ref }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if goal.preferences %}
Please respect these reasoning preferences:
{% for key, value in goal.preferences.items() %}
- {{ key|capitalize }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

Please output a numbered list of reasoning steps. Each step should be concise, complete, and independent enough to be evaluated or executed on its own.

Example Format:
1. [Understanding] Restate the goal and clarify key terms.
2. [Concept Identification] Identify relevant principles or prior knowledge.
3. [Application] Map the concepts onto the problem.
4. [Verification] Evaluate the plausibility of the solution.

Now generate your reasoning plan:
{{ gen['reasoning_plan'] }}

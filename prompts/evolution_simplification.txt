You are an expert researcher tasked with simplifying the following hypothesis for clarity and testability.

Goal: {goal}
Hypothesis: {hypothesis}

Instructions:
1. Identify overly complex or ambiguous parts of the hypothesis.
2. Rewrite it in simpler terms while retaining its scientific merit.
3. Suggest how this simplified version can be experimentally validated.
4. Avoid introducing new concepts â€” focus on making it more accessible.

Output only the simplified hypothesis followed by a brief explanation of the simplification process.

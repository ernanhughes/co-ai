You are an expert in logical reasoning and hypothesis verification.
Perform a deep verification of the following hypothesis by decomposing it into core assumptions.

Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Goal: {goal}

Instructions:
1. List all key assumptions underlying the hypothesis.
2. For each assumption:
   - Is it supported by existing evidence?
   - Can it be tested directly?
   - What would disprove it?
3. Determine if the hypothesis depends on invalid assumptions.
4. Provide a final assessment of the hypothesis validity.

Format your output EXACTLY as follows:

# Core Assumptions
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]
- [Assumption 3]

# Assumption Verification
## Assumption 1:
Evidence: [supporting/contradictory/neutral]
Testability: [Yes/No] â€“ Brief explanation
Impact: [Fundamental / Minor]

## Assumption 2:
Evidence: [supporting/contradictory/neutral]
Testability: [Yes/No]
Impact: [Fundamental / Minor]

...

# Final Assessment
Verdict: [Valid / Invalid / Needs refinement]
Explanation: [Brief reasoning]

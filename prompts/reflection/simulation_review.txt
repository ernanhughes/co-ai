You are an expert in mechanistic simulation and predictive modeling.
Simulate the biological mechanism implied by the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
Goal: {goal}

Instructions:
1. Break the hypothesis into sequential steps of biological events.
2. Simulate each step and identify potential failure points.
3. Describe expected experimental outcomes if the hypothesis were true.
4. Identify possible confounding factors or alternative explanations.

Format your output EXACTLY as follows:

# Mechanism Simulation
## Step-by-step breakdown:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Potential Failure Points
- [Failure Point 1]
- [Failure Point 2]

## Expected Experimental Outcomes
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]

## Confounding Factors
- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]

# Conclusion
[Hypothesis viability: Strongly supported / Supported with caveats / Likely incorrect]

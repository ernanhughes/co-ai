{% if preferences %}
When generating the result please be guided by these user preferences.
(These preferences guide how you evaluate the hypothesis. Examples include:
- "goal_aligned" → Focus on direct relevance
- "novelty_driven" → Look for unexpected but valid connections
- "feasibility_first" → Prioritize real-world applicability
- "biological_plausibility" → Ensure mechanism makes biological sense
- "simplicity" → Favor clean, clear explanations over complex ones)

Instructions:
1. Evaluate the hypothesis for biological plausibility
2. Assess whether it could be tested in the lab
3. Identify gaps or areas needing refinement
4. Return structured review like:
review:<valid>
mechanism:<supported>
score:<1–5>
justification:<reason>

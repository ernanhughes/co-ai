Your task:
1. Break the goal into sub-tasks or research questions.
2. Generate 5â€“10 search queries to find:
   - Relevant academic papers (Arxiv)
   - Code implementations (GitHub, HuggingFace)
   - Technical blog posts, benchmarks, or whitepapers (Web)

Prioritize queries that explore novel angles or unresolved challenges related to the goal.

Guidelines:
- Ensure each query aligns with at least one preference (e.g., factual accuracy, reliable sources).
- Favor queries that can lead to actionable insights for improving the co_ai framework or building self-improving agents.
- Include both broad and targeted queries to cover foundational and cutting-edge knowledge.

Return only the list of queries, one per line.

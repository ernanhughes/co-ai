Instructions:
1. Reformulate the goal into a focused search query that will return the most relevant, up-to-date scientific findings.
2. Focus on terms likely to appear in peer-reviewed literature, preprints (bioRxiv, arXiv), or review articles.
3. Use phrasing that surfaces open questions, conflicting results, or recent discoveries â€” these are useful for hypothesis generation.
4. Dont use 'site:scholar.google.com'

Your output should be a single search query that can be used with a web search engine to retrieve promising material for hypothesis generation.

Output format:

{% if target_type == "triple" %}

You are scoring a single knowledge triplet for **composability** with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Triplet
({{ triplet.subject }}, {{ triplet.predicate }}, {{ triplet.object }})

## Instructions

Composability means the triplet can be easily used alongside others to support planning, reasoning, or broader goal achievement. It should be generalizable, modular, and logically well-formed.

Return your review in the exact structured format below. Do not include headings, markdown, or additional commentary. Use only plain text fields as shown:

rationale: <brief explanation>  
score: <0–100>

{% elif target_type == "cartridge" %}

Evaluate the **composability** of the data cartridge with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

### Data cartridge
Title: {{ cartridge.title }}
Summary: {{ cartridge.summary }}
Sections:
{% for section in cartridge.sections %}
---
{{ section }}
{% endfor %}

Composability means the cartridge's content can be modularly combined with other cartridges or units of knowledge to support multi-step reasoning, action planning, or structured decision-making. Avoid overly specific, tangled, or standalone information.

{% elif target_type == "theorem" %}

Evaluate the **composability** of the following theorem with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Theorem
{{ theorem.statement }}

{% if theorem.proof %}
## Proof
{{ theorem.proof }}
{% endif %}

Composability refers to whether this theorem can be used in conjunction with other theorems, facts, or logic blocks to build up more complex arguments or solutions. Prefer general, well-structured, and reusable theorems over narrow or overly technical ones.

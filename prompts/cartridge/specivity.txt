{% if target_type == "triple" %}
You are scoring a single knowledge triplet for **specificity** with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Triplet
({{ triplet.subject }}, {{ triplet.predicate }}, {{ triplet.object }})

## Instructions

Specificity refers to how detailed, concrete, and narrowly focused the triplet is in addressing the goal. Vague or general statements should receive lower scores.

Return your review in the exact structured format below. Do not include headings, markdown, or additional commentary. Use only plain text fields as shown:

rationale: <brief explanation>  
score: <0–100>

{% elif target_type == "cartridge" %}

Evaluate the **specificity** of the data cartridge with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

### Data cartridge
Title: {{ cartridge.title }}
Summary: {{ cartridge.summary }}
Sections:
{% for section in cartridge.sections %}
---
{{ section }}
{% endfor %}

Specificity refers to how detailed and narrowly focused the cartridge is in addressing the goal. Favor precise, concrete statements and well-scoped claims over vague or generic ones.

{% elif target_type == "theorem" %}

Evaluate the **specificity** of the following theorem with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Theorem
{{ theorem.statement }}

{% if theorem.proof %}
## Proof
{{ theorem.proof }}
{% endif %}

Specificity means the theorem clearly applies to a well-defined case, condition, or mathematical structure relevant to the goal. More precise, scoped, and practically usable formulations should be rated higher.

{% if target_type == "triple" %}

You are scoring a single knowledge triplet for **confidence** with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Triplet
({{ triplet.subject }}, {{ triplet.predicate }}, {{ triplet.object }})

## Instructions

{% elif target_type == "cartridge" %}

Evaluate your **confidence** in the following data cartridge with reference to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

### Data cartridge
Title: {{ cartridge.title }}
Summary: {{ cartridge.summary }}
Sections:

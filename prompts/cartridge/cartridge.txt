You are a precision AI system tasked with extracting **goal-relevant, reusable knowledge** from documents.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Document
{{ text }}

{% if preferences %}
## Preferences
The following preferences should be respected:
{% for p in preferences %}
- {{ p }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if instructions %}
## Additional Instructions
Please also follow these additional instructions:
{% for i in instructions %}
- {{ i }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

## Output Format (Markdown)

Please extract bullet-pointed knowledge aligned with the goal. Do **not summarize** — instead, extract **structured, reusable facts**, insights, or methods. Each point should be complete and understandable in isolation.

### Extracted Knowledge

- [Fact or insight #1, complete sentence, aligned with the goal]
- [Fact or insight #2...]
- ...

### Post-Extraction Self-Review

Review the extracted points. For each:
- Check that it aligns with the goal.
- Check that it’s not vague or generic.
- Check that it could be reused on its own in a new context.

If any point fails these checks, revise the output. Repeat until the list is sharp and relevant.

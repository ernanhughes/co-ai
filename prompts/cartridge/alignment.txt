{% if target_type == "triple" %}
You are scoring a single knowledge triplet for **alignment** to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Triplet
({{ triplet.subject }}, {{ triplet.predicate }}, {{ triplet.object }})

## Instructions

Alignment refers to how well the triplet reflects, reinforces, or correctly interprets the intention and framing of the goal — not just relevance, but correctness and philosophical or conceptual agreement.

{% elif target_type == "cartridge" %}

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

### Data cartridge
Title: {{ cartridge.title }}

{% elif target_type == "theorem" %}
Evaluate the **alignment** of the following theorem in relation to the goal.

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Theorem
{{ theorem.statement }}

{% if theorem.proof %}
## Proof
{{ theorem.proof }}
{% endif %}

Alignment means the theorem's assumptions, framing, and implications should be in conceptual agreement with the goal. Consider not just factual utility but whether the logic or values expressed are aligned with the goal's spirit.

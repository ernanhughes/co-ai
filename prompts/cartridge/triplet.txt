You are an AI system that transforms plain sentences into clean, reusable knowledge triplets (subject, predicate, object), and verifies the quality of each triplet.

Below is a list of knowledge points extracted from a document related to the goal:

## Goal
{{ goal.goal_text }}

## Knowledge Points
{% for point in points %}
- {{ point }}
{% endfor %}

---

## Instructions

Go through the list line-by-line. For each point:

1. **Extract** a clean triplet in the form (subject, predicate, object).
2. **Validate** the triplet by checking:
   - Is it clearly stated?
   - Is it factually grounded in the point?
   - Does it follow a subject–predicate–object structure?
3. **Only include the triplet if it passes all checks.** If no valid triplet can be extracted, skip it.
4. Use one triplet per bullet point. Use plain English.
5. Only return the triplets

### Output Format

- (Subject 1, Predicate 1, Object 1)
- (Subject 2, Predicate 2, Object 2)

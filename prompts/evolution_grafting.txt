You are an expert researcher skilled in hypothesis fusion.
Combine the best aspects of the following hypotheses into a unified, stronger version.

Hypothesis A: {hypothesis_a}
Hypothesis B: {hypothesis_b}

Instructions:
1. Compare both hypotheses â€” identify overlapping and complementary elements.
2. Merge them into a single hypothesis that preserves strengths and removes weaknesses.
3. Justify the grafting decision based on biological logic and testability.
4. Suggest one experimental approach to validate the combined hypothesis.

Output only the grafted hypothesis and a short explanation of the combination.

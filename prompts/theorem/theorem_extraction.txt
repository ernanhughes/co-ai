You are a scientific assistant helping to extract theorem-like statements from technical text.

Text:
{{section_text}}

---

Your task:
Extract statements that are general, rule-like, or resemble formal theorems, such as:
- Statements of the form “If ..., then ...”
- General properties that apply across cases, like “Every X satisfies Y”
- Explicit declarations like “Theorem: ...”, “Principle: ...”, or “In all cases, ...”

Be flexible: extract the *core idea*, even if the statement is not perfectly formal.

Respond with each extracted statement on its own line. Do not include bullet points, numbers, or explanations.

Return nothing if no such statements can be found.

### Example
**Input text:**
A function is said to be continuous if, for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that ...

It is known that continuous functions on a closed interval are bounded and attain their maximum.

**Output:**
If a function is continuous, then for every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that ...
Continuous functions on closed intervals are bounded and attain their maximum.

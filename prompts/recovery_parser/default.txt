You are a robust parser that recovers structured fields from noisy or inconsistent text.

Here is the raw input:
{{ raw_text }}

The expected fields are:
{% for field in expected_fields %}
- {{ field }}
{% endfor %}

Here is a regex hint that failed to match:
{{ regex_hint }}

Your task is to extract the expected fields and return them as a JSON object.
Only include the fields listed above. If a field is missing or unclear, leave it null.

Return **valid JSON only** with no extra commentary.

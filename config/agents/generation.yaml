    You are an expert researcher participating in a collaborative discourse to generate novel, testable hypotheses.

    Goal: {goal}

    Instructions:
    1. Generate exactly 3 distinct, scientifically grounded hypotheses.
    2. Each hypothesis must be self-contained and actionableâ€”clearly stating a proposed mechanism or cause-effect relationship.
    3. Include a brief rationale for each hypothesis based on current knowledge or analogies.
    4. Suggest one feasible experiment per hypothesis to validate or refute it.
    5. Format your output EXACTLY as follows:

    Hypothesis 1:
    [Hypothesis Statement]
    Rationale:
    [Brief explanation of why this is plausible]
    Experiment:
    [Simple experiment to test]

    Hypothesis 2:
    [Hypothesis Statement]
    Rationale:
    [Brief explanation]
    Experiment:
    [Simple experiment to test]

    Hypothesis 3:
    [Hypothesis Statement]
    Rationale:
    [Brief explanation]
    Experiment:
    [Simple experiment to test]

    Do NOT include any additional commentary or formatting. Output only the three hypotheses in the structure above.
